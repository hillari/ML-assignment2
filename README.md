## Implementing a Regression Model
This repo is only for part 2 of Machine Leaning Assignment 2. Bayes Net will not be covered here.  
Part 2 implements a regressor using Scikit learn to determine which variables in the data set affect life expectancy.  

3/10/2020 - Model now implements Linear Regression in Scikit-Learn. Missing values are item nonresponse and 
have been handled with SimpleImputer. Currently, the only values that have been dropped are missing observations 
in "Life expectancy".
